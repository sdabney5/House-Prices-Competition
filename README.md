# House-Prices-Competition
Kaggle Competition. House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques


## Overview:  
The challenge for this project is to build a ML model to predict Real Estate Sales Prices. It was built for two purposes:

First, this is my Capstone Project for certification through Elite Data Science's Machine Learning course. As such, it should demonstrat 'sufficient proficiency in applied machine learning' as verified by Elite Data Science
Second, it was built to make a submission to the Kaggle Competition 'House Prices- Advanced Regression Techniques'. I used 'The Ames Housing dataset' from Dean De Cock to train the model and submitted predictions for a Test Set through Kaggle.
